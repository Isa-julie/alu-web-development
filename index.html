    <h1> Hello world ! </h1>
    <h2> My website </h2>
    <h3> Meet the creator </h3>

    <p> Here is the first class project while working on HTML </p>
    <p> HTML was first developed in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and its original version only had 18 tags, many of which are still in use today! </p>
    <a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/ZMxDzYWJER8XYdpd6">
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
    </a>
    <p> The marquee tag, though deprecated, was once a fun way to create scrolling text or images on web pages and remains a nostalgic relic of early internet design. </p>
    <p> You can use emojis in HTML code directly, either by typing them or using their numeric entity codes, making pages more expressive and fun! </p>
